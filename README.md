# esjs (embedded sjs)

* This repo is based on https://github.com/spark-jobserver/spark-jobserver (SJS)

* In this repo, an attempt is made to embed SJS in a Servlet Container like Tomcat or Jetty

* Here's what's working up until now ...

* SJS can be deployed to Tomcat

* SJS UI can be seen by accessing Tomcat's SJS webapp (example: http://host:8080/sjs)

* Upload jar using curl and and view the uploaded jar using curl

* And, here's the issue faced as of now ...

* Unable to submit job
